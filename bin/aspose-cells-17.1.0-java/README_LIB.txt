This file describes what folder contains the jars you need to use with a particular JDK version. Aspose.Cells for Java
supports JDK 1.6, 1.7 or greater versions. The "JDK 1.X\lib" folder contains jars for the respective JDKs e.g.
JDK 1.6. This single Jar file supports JDK 1.6, 1.7 and above versions.

Note: If you need JDK 1.4 or 1.5 version of the product, we can provide you with separate jar(s) on demand, you may request us by 
posting into the Aspose.Cells forum (http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/aspose.cells-product-family/19/showforum.aspx).

There are some other jars (with component's main jar file i.e. "aspose-cells-x.x.x.jar") which are also used by the
component for other significant functionality and operations, We recommend you should also set all these jars into
your classpath to work with the product with full capacity. 

The following jars are there in the "\lib" folder of the release archive:
